### First steps

My first contact with **web development** was when I was a teenager. I was studying a technical course called **Visual Communication**, which is a combination of various subjects related to **graphic design**. In this course I had a foundation of **HTML and CSS**, **vectoring**, **image editing**, photography, drawing and more. This made my transition to **Frontend** relatively smooth. During this period I didn't know which college to attend so I ended up taking another **technical course**, this time in **administration**. It was important, because thanks to him I got my first job as an intern, but I still wasn't satisfied. When the internship ended, due to lack of experience and an economic crisis, I was unemployed for 2 years, but I invested the money I had earned to **improve my English skills**.

### Joining tech

When my money ran out, I decided to go to college and started studying **IT Management**. At the time I had no idea what the IT areas were, let alone **which I wanted to specialize in**, so I chose the **broadest** course possible. The first year was extremely **productive**, luckily I got a **scholarship**, for being first place at the entrance exam, which allowed me to focus 100% on my studies. The wait was worth it, because **one of my teachers** recognized my effort and **pointed me for a programming internship**, which was my first experience in the development market. At this stage I had a solid foundation of **JavaScript**, **NodeJS** and **React**, and had the opportunity to graduate and be promoted to **Junior Frontend Developer**. I also had contact with the world of **cryptocurrencies, blockchain and smart contracts**. I know a lot about the theory and functioning of the ecosystem, so much so that it was the subject of my **Course Conclusion Paper**.

### Consolidating experience

When I felt ready to be a **full developer** I joined another company that provided services to **banks**. At this company I was allocated to a squad of a bank, where I had the opportunity to **meet cool people**, which allowed me to grow a lot as a developer. Around this time I started to **study several things in parallel**, like creating **libraries**, **Storybook**, **Nestjs**, **xstate** and advanced **typescript**. Eventually I reached a position of **squad leader**, and was able to help several developers and **learn how to manage a squad with kanban**.

### Broadening horizons

Again by **recommendation**, this time from my **ex boss** who hired me for this last company, I joined one of the largest **insurers** in the country as **Frontend Solutions Architect** .
