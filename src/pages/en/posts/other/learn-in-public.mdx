# Learn in public

## A way of think, learn and share

---

### Giving some context

I use to think the fact that I'm **Brazilian** was a huge factor that, deterministically, would **prevent** me to be an exceptional developer. Creating a wall from which I could not trespass. It's true that being born at a first world country is a huge **privilege**, for staters the **language barrier** is non existent, but after this unfortunate pandemic :Â´( the process of **globalization** took another step in favor of remote working.

The ideia of this article, and to be fair this whole site, came from another article with the same title ["Learn in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public 'Learn in public')
