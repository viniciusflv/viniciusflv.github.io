# Learn in public

## A way of think, learn and share

---

### Giving some context

I use to think the fact that I'm **Brazilian** was a huge factor that, deterministically, would **prevent** me to be an exceptional developer. Creating a wall from which I could not trespass. It's true that being born at a first world country is a huge **privilege**, for staters the **language barrier** is non existent, but after this unfortunate pandemic :´( the process of **globalization** took a huge step in favor of remote working.

The ideia of this article, and to be fair this whole site, came from another article with the same title ["Learn in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public 'Learn in public') from [@swyx](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=swyx 'swyx twitter'). At this article swyx mentions what he calls the **#1 golden rule**, `Learning in public`.

### Really Inspiring

Why do I think this is an incredible way of think? How many times you had forgotten something that you use to know? How many times you wish you had documented that acquired knowledge? If your answers were, like mine, **multiple times**, than you know what I'am talking about.

Also as a non native English speaker, my intent is to translate every blog post to make it **accessible** for Portuguese speakers. Adding an extra layer to the original proposal.

### How can you do the same?

Find a path that works for you. Doesn't matter what you do, but how you do it. Think about how hard it was for you to acquire that knowledge and how can you make easier for the next developer and the future you.

Shawn gives some examples to follow:

> - Write blogs and tutorials and cheatsheets.
> - Speak at meetups and conferences.
> - Ask and answer things on Stackoverflow or Reddit. Avoid the walled gardens like Slack and Discord, they're not public.
> - Make Youtube videos or Twitch streams.
> - Start a newsletter.
> - Draw cartoons (people loooove cartoons!).
> - Enjoyed a coding video? Reach out to the speaker/instructor and thank them, and ask questions.
> - Make PR's to libraries you use.
> - Make your own libraries no one will ever use.
> - Clone stuff you like, from scratch, to see how they work.
> - Teach workshops.
> - Go to conferences and summarize what you learned.

And remember, this is not for being famous is for **ourself** and maybe for people that will find your content useful.
