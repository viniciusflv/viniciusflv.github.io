# Learn in public

## A way of think, learn and share

---

### Giving some context

I use to think the fact that I'm **Brazilian** was a huge factor that, deterministically, would **prevent** me to be an exceptional developer. Creating a wall from which I could not trespass. It's true that being born at a first world country is a huge **privilege**, for staters the **language barrier** is non existent, but after this unfortunate pandemic :´( the process of **globalization** took a huge step in favor of remote working.

The ideia of this article, and to be fair this whole site, came from another article with the same title ["Learn in public"](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public 'Learn in public') from [@swyx](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=swyx 'swyx twitter'). At this article swyx mentions what he calls the **#1 golden rule**, `Learning in public`.

### Really Inspiring

Why do I think this is an incredible way of think? How many times you had forgotten something that you use to know? How many times you wish you had documented that acquired knowledge?
