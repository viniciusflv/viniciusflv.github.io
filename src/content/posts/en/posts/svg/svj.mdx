### What are SVGs?

SVG (**Scalable Vector Graphics**) is an image representation format, which uses vector coordinates to draw a image. The more traditional formats like **png** and **jpg** can be classified as **bitmap**, which works by mapping and associating each **pixel** with a **color**, so when performing **zoom** the image has **quality loss**. Which is not the case with SVG by its nature, that why it's **scalable**.

### How to load on React applications?

There are several ways:

- You can open the .svg file and **copy paste** its contents to the HTML
- You can **load it as a image**
- You can use e [loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@svgr/webpack "npm svgr") to parse it to a component
- Or you can parse you SVG to JSON, w
- Ou vocÃª pode converter seu **SVG para JSON**, which is a native JavaScript format, using a [CLI svj](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svj "npm svj")

#### Pros e Cons

Let's **compare** each of these methods, taking into account the **following points**:

- **Unit effort** - Effort to run only once
- **Scalability** - Effort to run multiple times
- **Optimization** - Deleting useless tags
- **Performance** - Browser loading speed
- **Size** - Browser loading cost

##### Method: Copy the contents of the SVG file

- Pros
  - **Unit effort**: It's simple and straightforward
  - **Performance**: Being embedded in HTML so is good
- Cons
  - **Scalability**: It's complicated as it's a manual process
  - **Optimization**: Requires developer knowledge about SVGs, to do it manually
  - **Size**: It may be big, depending on the optimization done

##### Method: Upload as image

- Pros
  - **Unit effort**: Non-existent because it uses the platform
  - **Scalability**: As scalable as any image
- Cons
  - **Optimization**: Requires developer knowledge about SVGs, to do it manually
  - **Performance**: Performance compromised by requiring the .svg file request
  - **Size**: It may be big, depending on the optimization done

##### Method: Use a component loader

- Pros
  - **Unit effort**: Non-existent because it is done by the loader
  - **Scalability**: As scalable as any component
  - **Optimization**: It is optimized by the loader
- Cons
  - **Performance**: Performance compromised by the amount of JavaScript
  - **Size**: Too much JavaScript for something non-interactive

##### Method: Convert SVG to JSON with [svj](https://www.npmjs.com/package/svj "npm svj") CLI

- Pros
  - **Unit effort**: Non-existent because it is done by the CLI
  - **Scalability**: Non-existent because it is done by the CLI
  - **Optimization**: It is optimized by the CLI
  - **Performance**: Being embedded in HTML is good
  - **Size**: It's Three Shakeable and maybe lazy loadable

### How to use the CLI and adapter for React

Reserve a **folder for your SVGs** and another for the **file destination** (both can be the same) and run the CLI with the following command:

```shell
npx svj -i <svg-folder-path> -d <dist-folder> -r
```

Then **install** the adapter for React:

```shell
npm i @svjson/react
```

Now you can **import** it at your component, both the JSON of the SVG and the adapter, to **render** the SVG. Passing the svg in the prop **src** and an alternative text in the prop **alt** for accessibility:

```tsx
import { icon } from "<dist-folder>";
import { Svg } from "@svjson/react";

export function IconText() {
  return (
    <span>
      <span>text</span>
      <Svg alt="icon" src={icon} />
    </span>
  );
}
```
